# FlatLandsGenerator
A simple deep flatlands generator for bukkit

## Why though?
After re-launching my very dated server and moving to more recent plugins, chunk generation for my creative world turned out different for the "flat" preset. As I couldn't find any generator plugins for deep flat worlds (my flat world is actually 65 blocks deep) which had support for bukkit 1.15, I decided to write my own generator plugin.

This plugin is tested on bukkit **1.15.2**.

I might decide to further improve this plugin in the future, so that the blocks of a deep flat world could get adjusted easily. But for now, it is streamlined to do just the job I needed it to do.
